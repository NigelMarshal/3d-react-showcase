This is a partial clone of Apple's iPhone 15 pro product page where I am using GSAP for animation triggers coupled with Three.js to interact with 3D models of the iPhone, allowing the user to view different iPhone sizes and color schemes. 

## Technologies used:

- React
- Three.js
- GSAP
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
